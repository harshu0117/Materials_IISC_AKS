The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and of electric current to temperature differences. A thermoelectric device creates a voltage when there is a different temperature on each side. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, it creates a temperature difference (a heat flux) between its sides. It can cool one side and heat the other. It works by pressing two different types of materials against each other. The materials are selected so that one conducts electricity better than the other. When a temperature difference exists between the materials, a difference in charge carrier density occurs. This produces an electric voltage. The voltage is proportional to the temperature difference, and can be calculated as: where is the Seebeck coefficient, is the temperature difference, and is the absolute temperature. The Seebeck coefficient is also known as the thermoelectric power or the thermoelectric force. The Seebeck effect was discovered in 1821 by Thomas Johann Seebeck.
